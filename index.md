## Teaching

I'm a [Teaching Assistant Professor](https://stat.illinois.edu/directory/profile/kfindley){:target="_blank"} of Statistics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I specialize in creating curricular materials that are 1) scaleable to large classes, 2) accessible to students with different preparation levels, and 3) conceptually-driven toward core statistical ideas.

Much of my time at Illinois has been invested in redesigning our Introduction to Biostatistics course--an accelerated introductory course with applications relevant for students pursuing careers in the medical field. My course notes, as well as the lab assignments I use for these courses are shared under my Teaching Materials page and may be used and adapted freely!

## Research

As a statistics education researcher, I primarily conduct _qualitative_ research. Much of my recent work has focused on identifying [students' perspectives of statistics]([https://icots.info/11/?programme](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339712352_Assessing_the_Disciplinary_Perspectives_of_Introductory_Statistics_Students)){:target="_blank"} and understanding how [students' experiences may shape those perspectives](https://github.com/kelly-findley/kelly-findley.github.io/blob/756366e190accc07056addab8db5c49fd0c72ff6/data/ICOTS_11_lois_lane_superman_ironman.pdf){:target="_blank"} over time.

I also conduct research on various areas of student thinking in statistics that moves beyond deficit framings and instead identifies the [conceptual resources](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0502_1){:target="_blank"} students express. One area of interest for me in teaching Biostatistics has been identifying student resources and tensions around issues of causality and generalizability in relation to [statistical designs](https://www.causeweb.org/cause/uscots/uscots21/th-11-understanding-students-thoughts-about-experimental-design){:target="_blank"}. I have also conducted similar work studying [students' resources about sampling distributions for the mean](https://iase-web.org/documents/SERJ/SERJ18(1)_Findley.pdf?1558844313){:target="_blank"}.
