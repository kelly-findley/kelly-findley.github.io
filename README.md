## Teaching

I'm a [Teaching Assistant Professor](https://stat.illinois.edu/directory/profile/kfindley) of Statistics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I specialize in creating curricular materials that are 1) scaleable to large classes, 2) accessible to students with different preparation levels, and 3) conceptually-driven toward core statistical ideas.

Much of my time at Illinois has been invested in redesigning Introduction to Biostatistics (STAT 212)--an accelerated introductory course with applications relevant for students pursuing careers in the medical field. My course notes, as well as the lab assignments I use for these courses are shared below. My resources may be used and adapted freely!

## Research

As a statistics education researcher, I primarily conduct _qualitative_ research. My most recent project examines [students' perspectives of statistics](https://icots.info/11/?programme) and the experiences that shape those perspectives.

I also conduct research on various areas of student thinking in statistics that moves beyond deficit framings and instead identifies the [conceptual resources](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0502_1) students express. Most recently, I have been studying student resources and tensions around issues of causality and generalizability in relation to [statistical designs](https://www.causeweb.org/cause/uscots/uscots21/th-11-understanding-students-thoughts-about-experimental-design). I have also conducted similar work studying [students' resources about sampling distributions for the mean](https://iase-web.org/documents/SERJ/SERJ18(1)_Findley.pdf?1558844313).
