## What is Statistics all about?

Having first experienced statistics by reading sports standings in the newspaper, I always thought of statistics as facts and figures. Those early concept images, in combination with my early academic experiences in mathematics, created a rather rigid and rule-based perspective of what it means to do statistics. But as I had more experiences actually working with data and learning from others, I've since realized that statistical work is a space that thrives on creativity and diverse perspectives. And truthfully, my perspectives about the nature of statistics and my own pathways to contribute in the statistics world are still evolving!

But understanding perspectives of statistics is not merely an academic curiosity. How students think about a field can have big implications on their learning and sense of belonging. And in the United States, the field of statistics has struggled to attract learners of all backgrounds.
